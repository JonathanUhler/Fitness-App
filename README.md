# Fitness-App

A Swift iOS app that mimics the Apple Watch fitness "rings" and runs on iPhones.

The application reads health data and displays it (in relationship to a goal set by the user) on three rings that track mileage, calories, and steps.

In order to use, open a new Xcode project with a clone of the repo inside and build the project with Xcode.
